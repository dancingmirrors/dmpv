// Return a platform-specific path, identified by the type parameter. If the
// return value is allocated, talloc_ctx is used as talloc parent context.
//
// The following type values are defined:
//  "home"          the native dmpv-specific user config dir
//  "old_home"      same as "home", but lesser priority (compatibility)
//  "global"        the least priority, global config file location
//  "desktop"       path to desktop contents
//
//  These additional types are also defined. However, they are not necessarily
//  implemented on every platform. Unlike some other type values that are
//  platform specific, the value of "home" is returned
//  instead if these types are not explicitly defined.
//  "cache"         the native dmpv-specific user cache dir
//  "state"         the native dmpv-specific user state dir
//
// It is allowed to return a static string, so the caller must set talloc_ctx
// to something other than NULL to avoid memory leaks.
