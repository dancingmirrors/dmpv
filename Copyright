mpv is a fork of mplayer2, which is a fork of MPlayer.

This particular fork of mpv as a whole is licensed under the GNU Lesser General
Public License LGPL version 2 or later (LGPLv2.1+ in this document; see LICENSE
for the full license text).

Some files are available under more liberal licenses, such as BSD, MIT, ISC, and
possibly others. Look at the copyright header of each source file, and grep the
sources for "Copyright" if you need to know details. C source files without
Copyright notice are usually licensed as LGPLv2.1+. Also see the list of files
with specific licenses below (not all files can have a standard license
header). "v2.1+" in this context means "version 2.1 or later".

All new contributions must be LGPLv2.1+ licensed. Using a more liberal license
compatible with LGPLv2.1+ is also okay.

Changes done to the old GPL code had to come with the implicit/explicit
agreement that the project could relicense the changes to LGPLv2.1+ at a later
point without asking the contributor. To add a LGPL mode to mpv, MPlayer code
had to be relicensed from GPLv2+ to LGPLv2.1+ by asking the MPlayer authors for
permission.

contains the complete SVN and CVS history as well.
